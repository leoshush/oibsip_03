This is a to-do list app.
Tools used in developing it were HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
I have made a add task container with a description , which is used to add new tasks to pending list.
To show the tasks , i have created a pending task bar in which you can see the task description and the date and time , the task was added.
On completion of tasks you can move it to completed tasks bar and from you can delete it.
